# StealthCommand
This script implements a simple TCP server that allows remote command execution. Clients can connect to the server, send shell commands, and receive the output. The server runs as a daemon in the background, making it discreet and capable of handling multiple client connections simultaneously. This type of script could be used for tasks like remote administration or exploitation, and it's designed to operate silently without user interaction, suppressing output to the terminal. It also forks the process to ensure persistence, allowing it to run independently even if the user closes the terminal or logs out. The use of threads allows for concurrent handling of multiple client connections, enhancing its scalability. Additionally, by using the setproctitle module, the script can change the name of the process, making it more difficult to detect and identify in process listings.
